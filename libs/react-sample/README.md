# react-sample-lib

This workspace contains a library of reusable React components that are designed to be shared across different sample applications within this monorepo. It provides an example of a suggested file structure for a React application.

> [!WARNING]  
> In a real project, it is recommended not to separate components into a distinct library unless a genuine need arises, as this can introduce unnecessary complexity.
