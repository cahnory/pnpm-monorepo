# Custom components

The "custom" folder exclusively contains custom React components designed to encapsulate application-specific functionality or user interface elements that are tailored to meet the unique requirements of the application.

## Conventions

- Each custom component **MUST** follows [regular components conventions](../README.md#conventions)

Following this convention, the file structure of a _Button_ custom component could look like this:

```
components
└── custom
    └── Button
        ├── Button.css.ts
        └── Button.tsx
```
