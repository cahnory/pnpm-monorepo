# Primitive components

The "primitives" folder exclusively contains headless React components designed for handling core functionality and logic, without any predefined user interface or visual rendering.

## Conventions

- Each primitive component **MUST** follows [regular components conventions](../README.md#conventions)
- Each primitive component's name **MUST** ends with "Primitive"

Following this convention, the file structure of a _Button_ primitive component could look like this:

```
components
└── primitives
    └── ButtonPrimitive
        └── ButtonPrimitive.tsx
```
